Nostalgia:

I will create a web app with a responsive design. Our world is getting more modern everyday with the improvements in technology. We are adapting to a new lifestyle. What do we do to keep the valuable moments that we live? We take pictures. But where do we store them? Not many years ago before social media being this popular we use to have photo albums. People used to go to each others house to look at the pictures that they have taken in a holiday. Right now everyone sees the photos in each others instagram, facebook or twitter feeds. Why shouldn't we have some nostalgia? The aim of the web app is to create a virtual book of photos that will be sent to the address that the user desires, as a digital copy.. The photos that will be present in the book will be fetched from instagram.. The user will connect to the instagram, the program will get the photos from their profile.. The user can adjust settings whether they want to see the date the comments and the tags.. Every photo will be in one page.. The user can add a contributer to the creation process of the book.. So two or more people can insert photos to the book and they can change the places of the photos. There is an app called chatbooks in the app store that does the thing that I have just described. A friend of mine and me decided to create a business in our hometown Istanbul. So I will be basically creating the same app "chatbooks" but as a web app and it will be based on Turkey. The project will hopefully turn in to actual business. Check the app chatbooks if you have questions.. I will only get the photos from instagram right now. In the future I aim to integrate this to also facebook and any digital photos that the user has.. It is fun idea because the users will have their social media photos as a hard copy like in the old times. It will also be cheap..



Javascript mongodb:

So I will use Node.js in backhand and I will use angular.js and other client side technologies in the front end.. I will be using the instagrams api. 

I will have 3 schemas. The first one will contain basic user info.. The second one will have the books and it will be connected to the users if there are more than one contributer. And the last one will contain the images that I fetched from instagram..


My wireframes are in the images folder..


USER story:

user logs in or creates an account or directly creates a book.. they connect to their instagram sothe photos get uploadded.. they change the settings if they want.. and change the images positions and pick a cover photo.. and then go to checkout..



Research:
I will research on express sessions and instagram api and other client-side ajax requests.. also database mongodb and how to store the pictures..
